IconDrop is a **SVG icon-manager** desktop app for Windows and OSX.

Essentially it comes filled with many ready-to-use icons packs to use in **Photoshop**, **Illustrator** or **Sketch**, for example, by simply drag'n'droping it (you are actually dragging a SVG file).

**Download:** Windows or  OSX
